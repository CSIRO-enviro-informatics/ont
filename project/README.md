# ont/project
A core vocabulary for describing a project, any kind of project.

The goal is a 'core' project ontology, with minimal dependencies, which can be extended for more domain specific applications. The design is influenced by
* VIVO-ISF http://vivoweb.org/ontology/core
* dbPedia http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Project
plus requirements from TDWG through the PPSR project.
